# Ziyakha Engineering - Website (Starter)

This is a small static-site starter for Ziyakha Engineering Pty Ltd.

What’s included
- index.html — main page with header, hero, services, projects and contact sections.
- css/styles.css — responsive styles and layout.
- assets/ — put your logo and images here:
  - assets/logo.png (recommended 1:1 or wide logo)
  - assets/hero-image.jpg (screenshot or hero background)
  - assets/project-placeholder.jpg (project thumbnails)

How to preview locally
1. Clone the repo (or copy files into your local folder).
2. From the project folder run a local server, for example:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000/`
   - Or open `index.html` directly in your browser.

Customize
- Replace colors in `css/styles.css` (see `--color-accent`).
- Replace `assets/logo.png` and `assets/hero-image.jpg` with the logo and screenshot you’ll provide.
- Add more sections or convert to a React/Next.js app if you prefer dynamic content.

Next steps I can take for you
- Update the layout to match the screenshot exactly once you upload it.
- Convert this scaffold to a React/Next.js project if you want SPA/SSR.
- Commit these files to your GitHub repo and create a branch or set up GitHub Pages for hosting.

Tell me:
- Please upload the screenshot and the logo (PNG/SVG).
- Do you want a plain static site or a React/Next.js implementation?
- Would you like me to create a branch and push these files to your repo?
